*The following section serves as a template for Data@Rensselaer's Jupyter book generator, which helps streamline the process of creating and publishing course websites that implement Jupyter notebooks.*

*To create a Jupyter book with all of the supporting pages like this (including a Schedule, Session pages, etc.), you must first make sure you have the software necessary to create Jupyter notebooks (i.e. Anaconda) and then install the jupyter-book package. Follow the documentation found in the site's [repository](https://github.com/RPI-DATA/course-intro-ml-app) to learn how to create your own book.*
